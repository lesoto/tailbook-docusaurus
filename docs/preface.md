# Preface

## About this book

This book is written to help you learn Tailwind CSS quickly. This book is designed to give you a really solid understanding of [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com) even if you’ve never used it before. Over the course of **X lessons**, you’ll start with a completely empty directory and finish with a fancy, fully-fledged website. In this course, we go from a completely empty directory to a full-blown marketing site, and along the way, we dive really deep into Tailwind CSS and front-end development best practices. The book does not assume any prior knowledge of coding. For absolute beginners, complex concepts are explained in an easy to understand way. If you're an experienced coder but new to CSS, this book will cover Tailwind CSS in enough depth to get you started coding right away. The project uses the knowledge gained in the book and allows you to see how it all relates to each other.

In this course, we go from a completely empty directory to a full-blown marketing site for a design agency, and along the way, we dive really deep into Tailwind CSS and front-end development best practices. Over the course of simple lessons, you will learn core Tailwind CSS platform knowledge—step-by-step—to build out a real-world project. The linear project structure helps your learning because you’re working with a real context, rather than abstract exercises. Each chapter contains code examples and exercises at the end. All examples and images in the book are chosen to demonstrate concepts and help you understand the material in depth. During the training, you can download the bonus project and the source code of all exercises. The exercises are designed to reinforce your understanding of Tailwind CSS. The book comes with an additional project that will guide you through coding a web page completely from scratch. You don’t need to be an experienced developer to take this course. All you need is basic HTML and CSS skills, with some optional JavaScript skills. Everything is explained, in detail, in a friendly, conversational manner, and if you get stuck in any of the lessons, you can download the project files, so you’ll have no blockers and you’ll maintain your momentum.

It’s not just a course about Tailwind CSS, either. We’re learning how to build a fast, lightweight website that’s progressively enhanced with the user at the forefront. You’re going to learn some solid HTML, CSS and accessibility best practices just by completing this course. You’ll learn about design implementation, details and refinement to achieve a solid, professional end-product.

## Who this book is for

Learning Tailwind CSS is for both beginners and experienced web designers and developers who want to create professional looking dynamic websites. No prior knowledge of Tailwind CSS is required. Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS in addition to a little knowledge of JavaScript is essential for beginners who want to learn Tailwind CSS.

This book is covering some of the HTML and CSS fundamentals that Tailwind CSS needs to know. While this overview is by no means exhaustive, it should be sufficient to complete most of the necessary developer tasks and provide all the platform know-how needed to use Tailwind CSS in real life projects.

## Conventions

Throughout this book, you will find several text styles that distinguish between different types of information.

## Essential Tools

Before we start coding our pages, let's first look at some of the recommended web programming tools. All you need is a web browser and a text editor to start coding websites. However, Tailwind CSS is highly recommended to use some of the free online coding tools. One of the most recommended tools is an advanced text editor that offers syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting means that the editor will display text in different colors depending on the purpose of the text. This simple feature will make your code much easier to read and debug.

You can use whatever text editor or IDE that you want to use for this course. You must however, make sure that you have a terminal installed:

1. On macOS, the default terminal app is more than OK. It lives in **Applications > Utilities > Terminal**
2. On Windows, I recommend using a terminal emulator
3. Linux users: I don’t need to tell you because you’re more than likely using a terminal already

::: tip

For all platforms, [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a really decent text editor with a built in terminal. It’s also 100% free.

If you’ve never used a terminal before, I strongly recommend using this software to complete this course.

Now that you have a terminal installed, we need to make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Luckily, you can find [handy installers on the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). I recommend using the **LTS version of Node.js**.

::: tip

You can check to see if you already have Node.js installed by running `node -v` in your terminal. If it shows a version number, you’ve got it, but if it throws an error, you need to go ahead and install it.
